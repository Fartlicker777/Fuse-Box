  description: "About one of these things should actually be in a fuse box, we just
    like to be flashy.\r\n\nTo properly experience the awesome-sauceum of this module,
    you should\n1. Use Windows 10/11.\n2. Go to Settings -> Privacy -> Speech and
    turn on Online Speech Recognition.\nThis module is possible without it, but it's
    lame without this setting.\n\nMade for Modding Jam #5: 3 Sentence Manual (no I
    did not vote for this)\n\neXish helped with a majority of the coding.\n\nThe manual
    can be found in the manuals folder of the game or at ktane.timwi.de.\n\r\nContact
    Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord if there are any bugs."
